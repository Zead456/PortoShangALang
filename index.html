          <p>Ducks are remarkably social creatures, thriving in flocks where communication and cooperation are key. They engage in complex behaviors like synchronized swimming, vocal signaling, and communal nesting. Within their groups, ducks form strong pair bonds, often mating for a season or longer, and exhibit protective instincts toward their young. Social hierarchies can emerge, with dominant ducks leading feeding or migration efforts. Their quacks, head bobs, and body language help maintain group cohesion and signal emotions or intentions. Whether dabbling in ponds or flying in formation, ducks rely on their social connections for safety, survival, and a surprisingly rich emotional life.</p>

          <p>Orcas, also known as killer whales, are masterful hunters with highly coordinated strategies. They hunt in pods, using teamwork to outsmart prey like seals, fish, and even whales. Techniques include wave-washing seals off ice floes, herding fish into tight balls, and stunning prey with tail slaps. Their intelligence and communication make them apex predators. Each pod may develop unique hunting methods, passed down through generations, showcasing orcas’ remarkable adaptability and cultural complexity in the wild.</p>
